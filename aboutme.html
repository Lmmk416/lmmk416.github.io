I recently graduated in May, 2022, with a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering on a pre-medicine track. 
I will be returning to the Univeristy of Buffalo to complete a Masters of Art in Biological Sciences, with a focus in Anatomy & Physiology.
These past few years I have been invovled in cadaver research projects which aid my knowledge of medicine and how it relates to the field of engineering. 
Some of my projects include the leg, foot, arm, hand, and a Nervous System dissection. I plan on continuing this research during my masters, focusing on the Nervous System dissection and hopefully a more Orthopedics based project as well. 


I am currently based in the Bay Area & I am an Assay Development Research Intern at Lucira Health.
I perform guard banding to test the tolerance to variation in the elution buffer and pellet for the COVID-19 FLU A+B Test.
Some techniques I have been utilizing are PCR, fLAMP-assays, and DNA/RNA purification in a BSL2 environment under GXP.
I also assit in data analysis and creating the product docments that will be sent to the FDA.

I am interested in the medical devices field, more specifically, orthopedic and surgical devices. 
I am currently continuing to work on a 3D printed, anatomcially correct hand that will be used for orthopedic surgical training.
I really enjoy the idea of working with physicans to identify a problem, conceptually design a product to fix that problem, and physically creating a successful protoype that will then be brought to manufacturing.


I would like to work full time in the Bay Area with a start date around June 2023.
