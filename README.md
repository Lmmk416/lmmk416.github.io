## Welcome to my website/online portfolio 

### I graduated in May 2022, with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering on a pre-medicine track. This past year I have been working on my Master of Art in Biological Sciences, with a focus on Human Anatomy & Cancer. I completed my MA coursework in May 2023, and I finished my cadaver research during the summer of 2023. I am currently looking for a full-time job as a clinical specialist or medical device engineer in either New York City Metropolitan Area or Buffalo, NY.
